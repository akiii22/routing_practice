        <h1>Alya Sometimes Hide Her Feelings in Russian</h1>
        <p>
          Alya, who sits next to Masachika Kuze, always gives him a cold,
          indifferent gaze. However, sometimes, she quietly lets her feelings
          slip out in Russianâ€¦ Those words do not go unnoticed by Masachika
          either. As it turns out, Masachika&apos;s listening comprehension in
          Russian is at a native level! Believing that he hasn&apos;t noticed,
          Alya occasionally shows her soft side. And Masachika, fully
          understanding its meaning, pretends as though he hasn&apos;t noticed.
          Unable to hide their smirks, where will the path of their romance take
          them?
